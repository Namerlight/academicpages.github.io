title: "Probing the intracellular refractive index and molecular interaction of gold nanoparticles in HeLa cells using single particle spectroscopy"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We have introduced a novel method to quantify the intracellular refractive index (RI) of living cells and determine the molecular interaction of two interacting molecules using single particle spectroscopy. The advantages of this proposed technique over fluorescence-based imaging techniques is that it does not require any contrasting agent and it does not blink and bleach. Instead, our technique provides a non-destructive, non-invasive, high-resolution imaging of live cells.'
