Dr. Mohsin obtained his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Nanotechnology/Nano-Bio-photonics from Swinburne University of Technology, Australia, December 2015. He received his BSc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) from Islamic University of Technology (IUT), Gazipur, Dhaka, November, 2008. From 2009 to 2011 he served as a Lecturer at the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Stamford University Bangladesh. Since 2011 to 2018, he worked for several department of Swinburne University of Technology, Australia in different capacities.

Dr. Mohsin worked as a multidisciplinary research scientist at the interface of engineering, physics and biology. His research interest includes nano-bio-photonics, plasmonic nanomaterial and its application, single particle microspectroscopy, nanoparticle cell interaction and live cell imaging,  renewables, embedded system design, automation, control and IoT.

Research Interests
======
Dr. Mohsinâ€™s Ph.D. dissertation was focused on developing advanced optical imaging technique to study the optical property of nanomaterial and the biological processes at single molecule level on living cell. He developed a novel technique which can proclaim microscopic view of molecular interaction and dynamics (e.g. 2-10 nm resolution) and macroscopic view of living organisms (e.g. within 100 nm) amalgamating nanoparticle plasmon coupling and image correlation spectroscopy technique. These combined techniques allows us not only to gain profound understanding of biological mysteries like co-localization and micromolecular interaction in living cells but also offers solution to understand unresolved discoveries in the field of cell biology and immunology, providing better understanding of spatiotemporal compartmentalization of biomolecules inside living cells breaking the 200 nm diffraction limit of light. In addition, he has been worked on several projects and contributed in the field of plasmonics, optical data storage, industry 4.0 project, Xilinx FPGA/CPLD and microcontroller based projects.

His research finding has been published in the leading optics, biophotonics and IEEE journals and peer reviewed conferences. These have been the ACS Material and Interface (impact factor 8.2), International Journal of Nanomedicine (Impact factor 4.5), Optics Express (impact factor 3.3), IEEE photonics Journals (impact factor 3.23) and IEEE Explorer. Dr. Mohsin actively contributed to the scientific talk and peer reviewed conferences organized by OSA, IONS-KOALA, SPIE, AIP and IEEE. Dr. Mohsin regularly reviews articles for numerous leading journals including IEEE, Elsevier and International Journal of Nanomedicine. He is an active member of IEEE, SPIE and OSA.
